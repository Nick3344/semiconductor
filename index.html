        Semiconductor chip is basically the brain of any electronic device,and they are responsible to carry out every single action in our electronic devices and cars. For example, in mixer, it controls the speed of the motor, In car there are hundreds of semiconductors that handle everything, starting from your keyless entry to automatic doors and even the functioning of your engine. And today, in this digital world that we live in, semiconductors are by far the most important components that keep the world functioning, starting from mobile phones to the biggest servers in the world. And they are as important, if not more important, than the Internet itself. So the question is, why is there a sudden shortage of semiconductors? And what is its impact on different industries?

        The first reason for this shortage is that the industry had already been growing at such a rapid pace that it was already at the brink of shortage. According to the semiconductor industry association, today, more than 100 billion integrated circuits are in use every single day, all across the world, which is literally equal to the number of stars in our corner of the Milky Way Galaxy. This market is so huge that even with giant players like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm, there still isn't enough supply to cater to the skyrocketing demand.

        Therefore, when the pandemic hit on one side, while the demand of electronic gadgets skyrocketed due to work from home, on the other side, due to the temporary shutdown of factories and shipping services, the demand went Beyond the supply capacities. And the reason why the shortage is so difficult to recover is because manufacturing a microchip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories, dust free rooms, multi $1,000,000 machines, molten tin and lasers. And since the manufacturing cannot be increased on such a short notice, the wait times for chip is increasing at an alarming rate, going from just 11.8 weeks in September 2019 to 21 weeks in August 2021. Meanwhile, according to status, the chip industry that was already worth â‚¹440 billion in 2020. This estimated to grow to 550 billion in 2021. And will touch $600 billion by early 2022. And this. And this drastic difference in supply and demand is the reason why companies from all across the world from different sectors have started facing production issues. And the four major industries that face the heat are the auto industry, the LED lighting industry, consumer electronics industry and the appliance industry.

        In the auto industry, while Ford and GM in the US. Have been drastically affected in India, like we saw in just the second quarter of 2022, Maruti could not produce an estimated 1.16 lack vehicles due to the semiconductor shortage. This is the reason why Maruti's output was nearly done by 60% in September, that to just before the festive season in India. In consumer electronics, while HP raised the price of its printers by 20% on an average in a single year, Sony It will not produce adequate supplies of its playstation 5 console until at least 2022. Similarly, a large number of companies have been deeply affected by the chip crisis.

        So in simple words, chip manufacturing is a complex process that requires multiple steps. So if each country sets of five divisions for five different processes, then it is both costly and time consuming. Which is why India, Australia, Japan and US have decided to collaborate together to implement only those processes that are their strengths and pass on the rest to the rest of the countries. For example, US as a global leader in semiconductor design, and American companies also dominate in electronic design automation and licensed intellectual property. Chinese companies enjoy dominant position in semiconductor materials and chemicals that are used for manufacturing chips and Japan is also market leader in Silicon Wafers and substrates on which the ic's get made. Similarly, Australia occupies an important place in the broader electronic supply chain, as it has access to the critical materials and advanced mining capabilities. And lastly, the semiconductor design requires large number of skilled engineers and labels,andnd this is where India comes in. So in the Quad summit, Australia, US, Japan and India have joined hands to build a robust Based on their strengths to eliminate their dependence on China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
